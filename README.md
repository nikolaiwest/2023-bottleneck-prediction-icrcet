### Abstract 
Manufacturing companies require an effective approach to predicting bottlenecks in order to proactively initiate improvement actions that prevent throughput losses before they occur. This paper presents a novel method for predicting dynamic bottlenecks in manufacturing systems. The approach is based on multivariate prediction of multi-step bottleneck activity, using buffer levels and past bottleneck behavior. A Long Short-Term Memory network is used to accomplish the prediction. The approach is presented descriptively using a simulated manufacturing system consisting of five stations and six buffers. The discrete event simulation, all generated manufacturing data, as well as the full code of the analysis, are made freely available in the documentation for this paper. The exemplary application of the case study shows that the proposed approach is effective in predicting future bottleneck locations. In a ten-fold cross-validation, the prediction achieves an average ratio of 95.23% correctly predicted bottlenecks for a forecasting horizon of 30 steps. To make the results comparable and generally usable, four comprehensive benchmarks are presented with approaches that do not use Machine Learning methods. To summarize the research, the paper provides a contribution to the manufacturing industry by enabling proactive decision-making for process improvement and optimization.
